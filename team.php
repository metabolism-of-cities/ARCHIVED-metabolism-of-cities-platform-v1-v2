            Consulting web developer and urban metabolism researcher.
            Initial creator of this website while doing
            research into the feasibility of undertaking an urban-scale Material
            Flow Analysis in a South African context. Paul enjoys combining IT and 
            urban metabolism research.

            de Bruxelles (Brussels, Belgium) and University of Melbourne,
            Australia. Through different research projects in Brussels and
            Melbourne, he has been interested in identifying the
            context-specific factors that influence urban metabolisms using a
            temporal and spatial perspective.

             <strong>Dr. Rupert J. Myers</strong> is a Postdoctoral Associate at the Center for Industrial
             Ecology in the Yale School of Forestry &mp; Environmental Studies. He has a Ph.D.
             in Materials Science &mp; Engineering from the University of Sheffield, is a
             chemical engineer by training, and has several years of research and
             consulting experience across industry, academia, and government.  His research
             is focused towards understanding the sustainability, chemistry, durability and
             performance of industrial materials, in particular cement-related materials
             and metals. Dr. Myers has a keen interest in developing more sustainable
             materials science and technology. He is currently researching the life cycles
             and criticality of metals and metalloids, which includes creating tools to
             more effectively analyze and store quantitative materials flow analysis
             information.
