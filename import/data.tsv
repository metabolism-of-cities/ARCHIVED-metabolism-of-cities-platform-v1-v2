	A material flow analysis and ecological footprint of York	York		Materials	MFA indicator	2000		Ecological footprint	1254615.00	hectares		York's ecological footprint is 46 times the land area of greater York. This is nearly the same size as the total area of the North Yorkshire Moors National Park. This land is actually located in various countries around the world. This includes for example, the land required to grow the seven tonnes of Ugandan vegetables York consumed and the land in Asian countries required to grow over 1,000 tonnes of cotton to provide all our clothes for 2000. The calculations also included the substantial notional land area required to sequester the CO 2 (including the CO 2 equivalents of other GHGs) emitted as a result of York's consumption.  When compared with the fair Earthshare (which is 2 hectares each) York's ecological footprint would have to be reduced by 71 percent in order to approach sustainability. There will be a large variation among the residents of York, where some will have an ecological footprint nearer 2 ha and others a footprint that exceeds 10 ha.
